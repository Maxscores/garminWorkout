7-Minute Workout application for Garmin watches.


This watch application drives you through the execution of 13 exercises as described in the article from ACSM'S Health & Fitness Journal:
High-Intensity Circuit Training Using Body Weight: Maximum Results With Minimal Investment (http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/05000/HIGH_INTENSITY_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_USING_BODY_WEIGHT_.5.aspx).


The watch displays a timer for the 30-second exercises followed by 10-second rest period. Duration of exercise and rest periods is configurable through Garmin Connect Mobile.

The application supports heart-rate monitor (HRM) and temperature sensor (Tempe).

If you achieve at least 6 exercises, the activity is recorded as a training activity in your Garmin profile.

The activity in your Garmin profile will include basic information such as date, time, total activity time.
    - Rest periods corresponds to pauses in the activity.
    - Each exercise corresponds to a lap.
    - Calories will be automatically calculated if a heart-rate monitor is used.
    - Heart-rate graph if a heart-rate monitor is used.
    - Temperature graph if a temperature sensor is used.
